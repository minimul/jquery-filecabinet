# Simple widget for multiple file uploads across browsers

### Problem
I needed a basic way to present multiple file uploads to the user.
### It needed to:
<p></p>
<ul class="standard-ul">
  <li>Easily add a new file.</li>
  <li>Easily remove a file.</li>
  <li>Have no image dependencies.</li>
  <li>In Internet Explorer only show the filename being uploaded, not the full path.</li>
  <li>The widget would need to be extensible, like associating a select field with the input[file] (see below).</li>
  <li>Numbering of the input[file] would need to support array naming (userfile[]) as well as numeric naming (userfile1,userfile2,etc).</li>
</ul>
Based on jquery(ui) using the widget pattern and qunit tests.
